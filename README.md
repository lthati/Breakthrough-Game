# Breakthrough-Game implemented in Java
Breakthrough is a two person game played on a 8X8 chessboard, designed by Dan Troyka. 

Each player has 16 pieces, initially positioned on the two rows nearest to the player.
The winner is the first player to move one of his pieces to the home row, the row farthest from the player. 
Players alternate to take turns, moving one piece per turn. 
White player begins.
A piece may move one square straight or diagonally forward towards the home row, if that square is empty. 
A piece, however, may only capture an opponent piece diagonally. 
When capturing, the opponent piece is removed from the board and the playerâ€™s piece takes that position, as we do in Chess.
